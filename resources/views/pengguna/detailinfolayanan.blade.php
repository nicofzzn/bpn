            When you enter into any new area of science, you almost always find yourself with a
            baffling new language of
            technical terms to learn before you can converse with the experts. This is certainly
            true in astronomy both in
            terms of terms that refer to the cosmos and terms that describe the tools of the trade,
            the most prevalent
            being the telescope.
